.SH NAME
anagram.py \(en generates a full list anagram sets of single words
in a chosen (combination of) language(s).
.
.
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
anagram.py  [\fIoptions\fP]  [\fIword\v'+0.2v'\s-31\s+3\v'-0.2v'\fP [ ... \fIword\v'+0.2v'\s-1n\s+1\v'-0.2v'\fP]]
.
.
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
anagram.py is a program that generates all sets of at least two (2) words matching
as a mutual anagrams in the chosen language(s) present on the system.
All words are ordered such that every such common anagram set appears on its own line.
.LP
N.B.: only \fIsingle word anagrams\fP are generated by this program,
no \fImulti-word anagrams\fP.
(For latter functionality, refer to the more advanced program `anagram\fBs\fP.py'.)
.LP
The \fIword\v'+0.2v'\s-31\s+3\v'-0.2v'\fP [ ... \fIword\v'+0.2v'\s-1n\s+1\v'-0.2v'\fP]
arguments are optional, and may be existing as well as non-existing words.
The program will in that case filter the results to show only the anagram words(s)
that match the given (combination of) word(s).
.LP
The program acts case-insensitive.
Accented characters are treated as equivalent to non-accented characters.
Interpunction symbols such as dots, apostrophs and hyphens do not need to match
in order to be part of an anagram.
.LP
Additionally, filters can be set for:
.IP \(en 3
word length, being the number of alphanumerical characters per word;
.IP \(en 3
minimal and/or maximal number of anagrams per set;
.IP \(en 3
characters to be all included and/or excluded.
.LP
Besides any single language, any \fIcombination\fP of languages can be set as well.
If no language option is given, Dutch is the default language.
.LP
The results are sent to standard output and can be piped to e.g. `less'
or other utilities and applications.
.LP
Perequisite is presence on the system of a word list in flat text format
of at least one language.
.LP
In its present form,
the program code references following language word lists: 
.IP \(bu 3
\fI/usr/share/dict/dutch\fP
.IP \(bu 3
\fI/usr/share/dict/american-english\fP
.IP \(bu 3
\fI/usr/share/dict/british-english\fP
.IP \(bu 3
\fI/usr/share/hunspell/de_DE_frami.dic\fP
.IP \(bu 3
\fI/usr/share/dict/french\fP
.IP \(bu 3
\fI/usr/share/dict/spanish\fP
.IP \(bu 3
\fI/usr/share/dict/italian\fP
.LP

.SH OPTIONS
anagram.py takes the following options:
.IP "\fB-a\fP"
Use American-English language dictionary.
.IP "\fB-b\fP"
Use British-English language dictionary.
.IP "\fB-d\fP"
Use Dutch language dictionary.
.IP "\fB-f\fP"
Use French language dictionary.
.IP "\fB-g\fP"
Use German language dictionary.
.IP "\fB-h\fP"
Help (this output).
.IP "\fB-i\fP"
Use Italian language dictionary.
.IP "\fB-s\fP"
Use Spanish language dictionary.
.IP "\fB-c\fP"
Use all language dictionaries combined.
.IP "\fB-l \fILENGTH\fP"
Print anagram sets with words of at least \fILENGTH\fP only,
being any positive integer representing the number of alphanumeric characters.
.IP "\fB-m \fIQTY\fP"
Print anagram sets with at least \fIQTY\fP results only,
being any positive integer.
If this option is not used, the default number of results per set is two (2).
.IP "\fB-M \fIQTY\fP"
Print anagram sets with at most \fIQTY\fP results only, being a positive integer.
.IP "\fB-I \fICHARS\fP"
Include words with all of these \fICHARS\fP only.
This option does take character case, accent marks and interpunction literally.
.IP "\fB-x \fICHARS\fP"

This option does take character case, accent marks and interpunction literally.
.LP
All options can be combined.
If no language option is given, Dutch is the default language.
